<h4>Reddit! (2016 edition)</h4>

<p>The goal of this site is to give Reddit a facelift. 
I want to implement material design to show Reddit in a modern, sleek, and beautiful way.</p>
<p>I am using Reddit's (super simple) json API to pull live data and display it in cards. Right now I have implemented the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Links to content that open in new tabs</li>
    <li>Links to the comments on reddit</li>
    <li>The score of each post</li>
    <li>A subreddit bar within the navbar to go to any sub directly (just type and hit enter!)</li>
    <li>A hamburger menu with a slideout panel to display the default subs</li>
  </ol>
<p>I still have a long way to go with this and I plan on implementing plenty more features. I want to get close to the full reddit website's functionality by the time I am done with this project. Enjoy!</p>
